<p>Iâ€™m a mechanical engineer passionate about innovation and problem-solving. I graduated from Pharos University in Alexandria in 2023, earning my degree in Mechanical Power Engineering. My graduation project focused on designing atmospheric water generators, showcasing my interest in sustainable and energy-efficient systems.

  After graduation, I delved into software engineering, joining the ALX program to build my skills in full-stack development. This journey enabled me to merge my engineering knowledge with technology, creating dynamic, user-friendly web applications. I specialize in tools like React, Flask, SQL, and Next.js, focusing on crafting scalable and secure solutions.

  With a solid foundation in mechanical systems and programming, I aim to contribute to impactful projects that drive innovation in engineering and technology. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, enhancing my skills, and finding creative ways to solve real-world challenges.
